# Description

Compute-based ocean water rendering project using OpenGL 1.1 for Baylor CSI 4341 (Computer Graphics w/ Dr. Poore) Final Project.

Wave field generated with Keith Lantz's implementation of Jerry Tessendorf's fast fourier transform technique and using my approach to dynamic, gaze-based LOD, including shape connection and skirt geometry.
